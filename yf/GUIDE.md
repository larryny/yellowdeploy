# Yellowfall - Beginner's Guide

Welcome to Yellowfall! This guide will teach you the game mechanics.

## Goal

Survive 30 days and defeat the boss by managing your food supply and building an army to fight off enemies. After victory, you can continue in **Unlimited Mode**!

## Getting Started

When you start, you have:
- **10 Food** - Keeps your units alive
- **1 Soldier** - Your fighting force
- **1 Farmer** - Your food producer
- **1 Granary** - Stores up to 10 food (excess is wasted!)
- **7 Cards** in your deck

## The Daily Cycle

Each day follows this pattern:

### 1. Card Selection

You draw 3 cards from your deck. You must pick one to add to your **Schedule**. The cards you don't pick go to the discard pile.

On **battle days** (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30), you'll see a warning before selecting your card!

### 2. Morning Phase

- Each **Farmer** produces +2 food
- Each unit (soldiers and farmers) eats 1 food
- If you don't have enough food, units die (soldiers first, then farmers)
- **Food over your granary capacity is wasted!** Watch your storage limit.

### 3. Schedule Phase

All cards in your schedule execute from left to right. Some cards execute once and go to the discard pile, while others stay in the schedule and execute every day.

### 4. Next Day

The day counter advances. On battle days, a **battle card** is added to your schedule after you select your card!

## Cards

| Card | Effect | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Forage** | +3 Food | Goes to discard after use |
| **Recruit** | +2 Soldiers | Goes to discard after use |
| **Caravan** | Opens shop | Goes to discard after use |
| **Granary** | +10 Storage | Goes to discard after use |
| **Homestead** | +1 Farmer | Stays in schedule |
| **Pasture** | +1 Food | Stays in schedule |
| **Barracks** | +1 Soldier | Stays in schedule |

## Battles

Battle days: Day 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30

The difficulty scales:
- Day 5: 1 Imp
- Day 10: 2 Imps
- Day 15: 3 Imps
- Day 20: 4 Imps
- Day 25: 5 Imps
- Day 30: **Boss + 5 Imps** (Boss Battle!)

When a battle card executes:

1. Your army (soldiers + farmers) fights the enemy
2. Units take turns attacking based on initiative rolls
3. Each unit locks onto a target until it's defeated
4. Battle continues until one side is eliminated

**Victory:** You may receive a loot card as a reward!

**Defeat:** Game Over!

### Unit Stats

| Unit | ATK | HP | Initiative | Notes |
|------|-----|-----|------------|-------|
| Soldier | 1 | 10 | 35-100 | Your main fighters |
| Farmer | 0 | 2 | 35-100 | Can be targeted but don't attack |
| Imp | 1 | 10 | 35-100 | Basic enemy |
| Boss | 10 | 100 | 25-50 | Fast and deadly! |

## The Shop (Caravan)

When you play a Caravan card, you can buy one card:

| Card | Cost |
|------|------|
| Forage | 1 Food |
| Homestead | 3 Food |
| Barracks | 5 Food |

## Deck Management

Your deck cycles through as you play:
- **Draw Pile**: Cards waiting to be drawn
- **Discard Pile**: Used cards and skipped cards
- When the draw pile is empty, the discard pile shuffles back in

Use the **Deck Button** (bottom left) to view both piles at any time.

## Granary (Storage)

Your granary limits how much food you can store:
- You start with **1 Granary** = 10 food capacity
- Each **Granary** card adds +10 to your storage
- After the morning phase, any food exceeding your capacity is **wasted**
- Granary cards can drop as loot from battles

**Example:** If you have 1 granary (10 capacity) and your farmers produce 15 food after eating, 5 food is lost!

## UI Controls

- **Deck Button** (bottom left): View your draw pile and discard pile
- **Speed Button** (1x/2x): Toggle faster playback speed

## Tips

- Cards that stay in the schedule are valuable - they keep giving benefits every day
- **Farmers** produce food but can't fight - protect them with soldiers!
- **Balance** food production with army building
- **Watch the day counter** - battles come every 5 days!
- Don't let your units starve - they die if there's not enough food
- Save up soldiers for the boss fight on Day 30!
- **Watch your granary capacity** - build more granaries as your food production grows to avoid waste

## Unlimited Mode

After defeating the boss on Day 30, you can click **Keep Playing** to enter Unlimited Mode!

In Unlimited Mode:
- Battles continue every 5 days (Day 35: 6 Imps, Day 40: 7 Imps, etc.)
- Boss battles occur on Day 60, 90, 120... with scaled difficulty:
  - Day 60: Boss x2 (200 HP, 20 ATK) + 10 Imps
  - Day 90: Boss x3 (300 HP, 30 ATK) + 15 Imps
- Boss battles now drop loot!

How long can you survive?
